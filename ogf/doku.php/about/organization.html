<h2 class="sectionedit1" id="background">Background</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The Open Grid Forum (OGF) was formed from the merger of the Global
Grid Forum (GGF) and the Enterprise Grid Alliance (EGA). GGF had a
rich history and established international presence within the
academic and research communities along with a growing participation
from industry. EGA was a consortium focused on developing and
promoting enterprise grid solutions. Together, we have the opportunity
to deliver faster results, communicate more clearly and collaborate
more effectively with other grid organizations and standards bodies.
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit2" id="organizational_framework">Organizational Framework</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The Open Grid Forum is a community-driven, open organization that
balances the requirements of organizational and individual members to
enable a result-oriented environment with broad participation and
mandate from the key stakeholders and the international grid community
at large. Figure 1 (Organizational Framework, pictured below)
includes several statements of intent critical to the overall design
and operation of OGF.

<h2 class="sectionedit3" id="structure_governance">Structure &amp; Governance</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The Structure &amp; Governance of OGF encourages &#039;grass roots&#039;
participation and promotes inclusiveness and technical meritocracy. It
is also designed to enable focused leadership, accountability and fast
decision-making throughout the various levels of the organization.
Figure 2 (OGF Organizational Structure, pictured below) illustrates how OGF is structured.
